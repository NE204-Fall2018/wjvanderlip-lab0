Energy calibration is a tedious but necessary step in nuclear data analysis. In future code,
the ability to link the calibration files to set databases or to even automate the selection of known energies
would greatly speed up the calibration process.  With our method, there persists a requirement to manually
enter values into the script before energy calibration is conducted. The reproducibility of this process is a valuable
tool moving forward and will improve our ability to process data.
