Using a linear fit from the energy calibration earlier, we applied this to the $^{133}$Ba data to yield the
plot below.

The accepted values were then compared against the energy values found thought the energy calibration, calculating the
percent difference between the two.

This comparison shows that the linear fit is good for higher gamma energies but is significantly
degraded for lower energy events.
